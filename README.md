# Web-Programming-Assignment
This assignment is about creating an e-commerce website for a music shop.

The website features an account system with a database, sessions, and custom CSS.

The database is hosted on the university's private network and connection remains functional.

Unfortunately this project was left incomplete, it was supposed to also feature a product management system.

Screenshots of the website:
